                    <h1>The reasons behind my choice</h1>
                    <p> First of all I need to say something, it was the hardest choice I have make in my 25 years of existence, everyone that I knew ask me about my reasons and I couldn't explain why at the moment, I didn’t know what to say, but now I just need to explain a little bit of context <br> <br>
                        
                    I started my career in business management in 2014, my background was a good match for that career just for one good reason, my family owns an ice factory and  for almost every summer vacation after my 15th birthday I worked there, so I’m not a stranger to the topics of finance, production and administration. <br> <br>
                        
                    Despite of my background that career wasn’t my first choice, in fact it wasn’t on my career options, it was something I enrolled to avoid being a bum for six months, my father told me that this institute (TECNM) had connections with other regions of Mexico, so if I want to, I could spend my first two semesters in my hometown and then I could apply for other institutes, for me that was the selling point. </p>
                    
                    <p>At that moment i thought there were no other options, I wanted to leave all behind, my family name and the advantages that came with it, the comfort of a middle-class family. I wanted my own adventure, I needed to test my character, I knew that I was weak at hearth, that I had no voice in my family and I felt lost. <br><br>
                    
                    After some research Puebla was my final decision, it was a place with good universities, low crime rate (at that time), I had family and friends there, but on negative side Puebla was (and still is) an expensive city, but everything was enough for me to test the “adult life”. <br><br>
                
                    At first, I got lost, choosing to skip class just to hang out with my friends, missing my classes because I didn’t know how to use the public transportation, everyone thought that I was there just to escape my hometown and they were right at the beginning. <br><br>
                    
                    After a few incidents and a good amount of attention calls I realized that the opportunity that I got was pretty good, that every time I failed a subject, I was wasting my time and money, so I needed to be better, I needed to step up my game. 
                    <br>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>As the time went on some of my teachers challenged me to surpass my limits and I’m grateful to them but there were the other kind of teachers: <br><br>
                    
                    This story was about a production course that I took, the teacher didn’t arrive for every class of the week and when she did she left the class earlier to hang around with her friends a have coffee with them, she didn’t teach at all, she only gave us some PDF’s and a 90’s movie so we can grasp onto something, she used the app kahoot to play some games in class, the breaking point occured when she picked up a fight with a teammate and that fight started to damage the grades of all of the team members, by the end, all of the team failed the course, I was furious, I approached the student council for some help, that the attitude towards the team and the class was unethical, my friends supported me with their signs, it wasn’t the first time the teacher exhibit that type of behavior, I just asked for justice.<br><br>
                
                    The case drawn the dean’s attention, the matter had to be solved quickly that was the dean's approach to the situaton. I had two meetings, one with the president of the student council that told me that he was "on my side" that he will set up a meeting with the superior of the teacher, he was the head of the industrial engineering department. <br><br>
                    
                    At the meeting with the head of department I noted that he was pissed at me for making so much noise, How? at the meeting he started to insult me, that I was a piece of shit that I didn’t deserve to be in the institute, that he was going to make sure that I will never get my degree of engineer, there were insults and racial slurs just for being from Chiapas. I managed to record every one of them, after 10 minutes of enduring his insults we reached a mutual goal, I needed to present an exam so I could validate all of my knowledge on the subject and that was all. <br><br>
                
                    After the meeting I was furious, I started to yell out loud, I had to endure all of the trash talk of that human being, I  talked with the president of the student council and told him about the meeting, he was pretty chill when he told me that the attitude of the head was pretty common that I should be thankful that he was involved (On that moment I knew something was going on). I also told him about the audio I recorded, he change in just a matter of seconds, he was furious about that, he knew I got enough evidence to fire him and he made me delete that and also made me sign some sort of NDA (little did I know the president was just a loyal servant for the head and I was signing so I couldn’t talk with someone about this), they were covering all up (NDA's and deleting the audio from the meeting). <br><br>
                
                    The day of the exam was the worst, the questions on the exam weren’t complete, data was missing, the questions made no sense, I told the teacher about it and he said to me “there are mathematical methods to complete this type of questions” (he was lying, I talked with a statistics teacher about that exam and he told me that there was no other method, that the data was insufficient). <br><br>

                    Obviously I failed that exam, they didn’t give me explanations about it, they didn't even show me the exam, the head and the president went silent about it, they started to avoid me, they didn’t respond my messages, I was furious, the rage within was unbearable. <br><br>

                    After that incident the teachers and the administrative staff started to treat me like an inconvenience, they tried to stall my progress with my career, and they succeeded at some point. (One time after this incident my career coordinator deleted some classes I had in my schedule, she told me that I had too much credits and that wasn't possible, there are other stories).
                    </p>
                    <p>At the beginning of 2020 I could see the shadow of COVID ravaging throughout China and making its way through Europe, I knew the things were not coming back to normal soon so I took a deep breathe and started to analyze everything, I broke into tiny pieces, I was in a dark place, and I didn’t want to go back, I have been worn out by every experience that I had there. <br><br>
                        
                    I used to say that I left my career in business management due to the COVID pandemic, but now I need to say the truth, I was tired, tired of dealing with inefficient bureaucracy, untouchable professors, obnoxious students, crime and racism against foreigners. I was fighting a war that I couldn’t win, that took a toll on me, I lost faith on the public education system of Mexico.
                        </p>

                    <p>But not everything was lost, the real treasure for me are these lessons right here.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Drugs stall your progress</li>
                            <li>Drinking alcohol is fun but at the end you are better off without it</li>
                            <li>A healthy diet is really REALLY IMPORTANT</li>
                            <li>Cup noodles are not part of a healthy diet</li>
                            <li>Time is precious</li>
                            <li>Not everyone needs to be saved</li>
                            <li>There are flaws within us and that's not the end of the world</li>
                            <li>Good friends are rare but they exist</li>
                            <li>Violence is not the solution</li>
                            <li>You're not entitled to anything</li>
                            <li>There are no good or bad consequences, just consequences that we have to deal with, whether we like it or not</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>

                    <p>After some time things started to change, I started to date my current girlfriend, she is special, she listened to me, she didn’t tried to judge me or mock me (some persons consider that normal I don't know why) and together we looked for opportunities to grow. </p>

                    <p>That's when we found Platzi, after that I recovered my joy in learning, it's an amazing platform, with amazing teachers, here I am, writing this in HTML and CSS, I never knew that I was capable of doing this, now I'm optimistic about my future thanks to the love of my life and Platzi.</p>

We are at the point where the integrity of the individual counts and not what the political leadership or the religious leadership says to do.”
